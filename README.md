# 911CallsDataAnalysis
Analyzing 911 calls in the Philadelphia area from December 2015 to August 2016

## Packages Used
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Pandas
- Numpy

## Outcomes
Correlation between time of day and number of calls was found as during evening hours(14:00 - 18:00) the highest number of calls were found. Also friday was the busiest day for 911 calls. 

## Method
Using Pandas I sorted, grouped, and categroized data by reason for call, time of day, month, and location. Then I input those features into seaborn plots to visualize and look for statistical anomalies in the data.
